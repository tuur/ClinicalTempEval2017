# KULeuven-LIIR at Clinical TempEval 2017

Code of the [KULeuven-LIIR submission for Clinical TempEval 2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/S/S17/S17-2181.pdf). We participated in all six subtasks, using a combination of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for event and temporal expression detection, and a structured perceptron for extracting temporal relations.

# What it does:
Training and prediction for the following six temporal information extraction tasks:
1. Detection of event spans (ES)
2. Identification of event attributes (EA)
3. Detection of temporal expressions (TS)
4. Attribute identification of temporal expressions
(TA)
5. Extraction of document-creation-time relations
for events (DR)
6. Extraction of narrative container relations (CR)
